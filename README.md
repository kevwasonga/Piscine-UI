# Colors and Moodboard

Welcome to the **Colors and Moodboard** project! This project focuses on practicing design principles such as color theory, moodboards, typography, and UI replication. It provides exercises to help you explore and create designs with a particular focus on visual aesthetics.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will be tasked with creating color palettes, moodboards, and typography for various briefs. Additionally, you will explore color combinations used in different digital products and replicate UI screens on Figma. 

## Project Requirements

### 1. **Find the Colors**
Your goal is to extract color palettes from seven different websites, and create a Figma file including:
- Screenshots of the main page for each website.
- Extracted colors and color codes (3 to 4 main colors).
- URLs of the websites.

**Websites:**
- [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/)

- [The SIFF](https://www.thesiff.com/)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/es/)
- [TED](https://www.ted.com/)

**Deliverable:** A Figma file with the color palettes, screenshots, and color codes for each website. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Colors_Extracted_Date_VersionNumber`

### 2. **Color Combinations**
Find 3 websites or apps that use each of the following color palette combinations:

For each brief:
- Include 5 to 12 images that align with the brief.
- Extract the main colors and display the color codes (RGB, Hex, or HSB).

**Deliverable:** A Figma file for each moodboard with extracted colors and images. Name your files as:  
`Name_FirstName_Moodboard_Brief_Date_VersionNumber`

### 4. **Typography**
Visit the following websites and identify the typographies used:
- [UNRIC](https://unric.org/no)
- [Strongbow Cider](https://www.strongbowcider.com/bug-exterminator-brisbane)

- [Artisans Canada](https://artisanscanada.com/)

**Deliverable:** A Figma file with the typographies used for each website. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Typography_Identification_Date_VersionNumber`

### 5. **Typography Moodboard**
From the previous moodboard exercise, select consistent typography and create a Figma file showing:
- One typography for a title.
- One for a button.
- One for a description.
- One for regular text.

**Deliverable:** A Figma file with typography used for the selected moodboards. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Typography_Moodboard_Date_VersionNumber`

### 6. **UI Challenges**
#### **Timer UI Challenge**
Create a timer UI using:
- Two half circles to draw the timer.
- Gradient fill for the main circle.
- Named layers and grouped elements.

**Deliverable:** A Figma file of the timer UI. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Timer_UI_Date_VersionNumber`

#### **Watches UI Challenge**
Replicate four watch screens using symbols and variants. Ensure:
- All layers are named and organized.
- Use overlays and masks for imported images.

**Deliverable:** A Figma file with the watch UI screens. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Watches_UI_Date_VersionNumber`

#### **Flight UI Challenge**
Replicate the flight UI screen with:
- Symbols and variants.
- Overlays and masks for imported images.

**Deliverable:** A Figma file with the flight UI. Name your file as:  
`Name_FirstName_Flight_UI_Date_VersionNumber`

#### **Spotify UI Challenge**

## Deliverables
1. **Figma Files:** Each of the above exercises will be delivered as separate Figma files.
2. **Github Upload:** All Figma files should be uploaded to GitHub in a zip folder named “colors-and-moodboard_Name_FirstName.”
